# Google Books

Deployed link: https://find-google-books.herokuapp.com/

# Description 
A full stack application allowing users to search for Google Books and save them to a MongoDB database. 

# Motivation
This app gives users a bite sized way to find books and keep track of their favorite ones.

# Results
Implements the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. Uses Socket.io for real time communication between the server and clients. Push notifications are displayed to all users on book save using the react-toastify package.

# Future Improvements
- [ ] Send push notifications to all users except for the client that saved a book
